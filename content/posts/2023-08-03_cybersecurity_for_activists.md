Today, I had the pleasure of discussing cybersecurity with 30 enthusiastic attendees at Stockholm Pride House who defied the rain and the risk of getting wet. 

I've conducted this seminar since 2020. At the height of the pandemy, I noticed a sharp rise in the need for cybersecurity as more and more individuals had to communicate and collaborate digitally due to the pandemic. These seminars is provided to level the playing field between those advocating for human rights and their antagonists who typically possess far more resources in terms of offensive cyber capabilities.

For those who attended - thank you for coming! You can find the handouts [here](https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/GphnZiju3bfupLhw3f1DTH7w/).
