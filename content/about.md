I am an IT and security manager at an international NGO in Sweden, and this is where I publish works of intrest and do some crazy experimentation behind the scenes. As I don't participate in big tech social media, this is where I have my presence. This site is not and will not be monetized.

## Topics that I engage with
- Health and well-being
- Sustainable living
- Digital privacy and sovereignty

## What I'm *not* doing now
As much as I like the idea of having a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), it's not feasible for me. Instead, I can tell you what I'm not doing now:
- Chasing aliens on Alpha Centauri
- Having a cup of tea with Cthulhu
- Worshiping the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)
