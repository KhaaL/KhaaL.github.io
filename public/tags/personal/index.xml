      <description>Since february 2023, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking courses at mooc.fi which is a free, open-source, self-paced course platform provided by the University of Helsinki in English. The courses I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking are:
Programming in Python, basic and advanced concepts. Cybersecurity base, covering introduction, securing software and advanced topics. Funnily enough, my goal was to only study Cybersecurity base, but I felt it was neccessary to have a grasp of basic programming which led me to the programming course.</description>

      <description>I am an IT and security manager at an international NGO in Sweden, and this is where I publish works of intrest and do some crazy experimentation behind the scenes. As I don&amp;rsquo;t participate in big tech social media, this is where I have my presence. This site is not and will not be monetized.
Topics that I engage with Health and well-being Sustainable living Digital privacy and sovereignty What I&amp;rsquo;m not doing now As much as I like the idea of having a now page, it&amp;rsquo;s not feasible for me.</description>
