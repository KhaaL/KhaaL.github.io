      <description>Do you remember the tale of 25,000 lesbian lumberjacks living together in northern Sweden? Chako Paul City, as the story goes, was guarded with an iron resolve to prevent any men from entering the city. Those daring enough to try were beaten to death, while any woman returning to the city had to undergo a ceremonial wash before reentry.
This was, of course, utter nonsense.
This story was fabricated by a journalist from the newspaper Xinhuanet.</description>
