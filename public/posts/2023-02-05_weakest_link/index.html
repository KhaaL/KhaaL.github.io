One example is exploiting the functionality in HTML links by presenting one thing visually and the actual link pointing to another destination. I’d argue that passwords, which is still a very common authentication method, is not very human friends nor particularly secure method for authentication. Yet it is abundant as an authentication method. Sometimes an end user may do everything correctly, but still contributes to a breach because of there is a serious vulnerability in the software that s/he uses, or because of a bad configuration when setting up the software. Even though humans are lazy by design and want to put as little effort than what is necessarily to get the job done, I’d argue that it is shifting the blame to “someone else” does not instill ownership of the issues at hand - which is that technology is often not resilient or robust enough. Also, lets not forget the principle of defence in depth, which purpose is to create several protective layers in case one fails. In the case of end users clicking phishing links, rather than all hell breaking loose, it should have been prevented by scanning incoming emails, scanning outgoing links, protecting documents with sensitive information through more sophisticated means or monitoring end-points for unusual patterns.\nTalking about end-users as the “weakest link” does nothing but alienate the people we want on our side in this battle, and more seriously, might do more harm in good when there is a lot of vulnerabilities (and hasty) implementations of IT-solutions. The problem is not the end users, but perhaps that the organisational work culture doesn’t value security high enough, and that our fundamental technologies lacks security in their design and often has it patched on as a afterthought.\nReferences: 1: Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World, Bruce Schneier .
