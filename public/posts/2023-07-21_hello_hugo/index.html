I drew a lot of inspiration from it, and with their latest switch to hugo - I took the plunge to it too. My reasons to go with hugo are:\nIt’s simple to manage content, you only need to edit markdown files. It’s fast, and focus is on static sites. It’s popular, and thus you can enjoy many tutorials, themes and more. One can question why I chose Github pages. The answer is: cost-efficiency and simplicity. I get to enjoy a lot of outgoing traffic at no cost, and Github actions have proven to be quite convinient. If Github would change to a service that I cannot get behind - I can always make use of my experience of running my own webserver and move my webpage back there. In the meantime, I don’t need to worry about more that 300 bogus attempts per day to find exploits on my server.\nThe only thing I’m missing, is a way to auto-publish to a pod on a Gemini pod.
